Welcome to the Front of the Terrific's To-Do List App challenge.

I took the liberty to deploy the App using Vercel. For the database I used Supabase, and the free plan allow me to have 2 users. One was mine for my own test, so I will share the credentials of the second user:

link: http://frontend-terrific-test-ew9y2dg1q.vercel.app
user: emailfortest@gmail.com
pass: 1234556

If you wanna install the project and use it, feel free to use it. You need to clone this repository, open the "todo-list-app" folder and run the frontend with the command: "npm start". The first page that you will find is the Login. 
Use the same credentials I mentioned before. On the Login also will find the Sign Up option, but the limitations on the Supabase plan won't let the Registration succeed. I'm sorry for that.

Thanks in advance,
Carlos
